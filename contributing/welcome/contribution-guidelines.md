* [x] fix important github issues about `next.dogehouse.tv`
* [x] review old pull requests

## How can I help?

* triage issues

* match design on figma
* on existing pages if you notice an inconsistency between figma and the website you can make a pr to fix it

## Features I thought I was going to add, but now I need to think about whether they fit with current DogeHouse vision

* [ ] create super admins
* [ ] create bot accounts
* [ ] room owner can allow all bots \| block all bots \| or individually allow bots to their room
